        <h2>C Intro</h2>
        <h2>What is C?</h2>
        <p>C is a powerful and versatile programming language that has been the foundation of modern computing for decades. Developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs, C is known for its efficiency, portability, and ability to interact closely with computer hardware.</p>
        <h2>Key Features of C</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><span class="bold">Structured Language - </span> C follows a structured programming approach, which helps in writing clean and organized code.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li><span class="bold">Low Level Capabilities - </span>Unlike high-level languages, C allows direct manipulation of memory and hardware, making it ideal for system programming.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li><span class="bold">Portability - </span>C programs can run on different platforms with minimal modifications, making it a widely used language across various operating systems.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li><span class="bold">Rich Library Support - </span>The standard C library provides numerous built-in functions that simplify complex programming tasks.</li>
            <p></p>
        </ol>
        <h2>Application of C</h2>
        <p>C is widely used in various fields, including:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><span class="bold">Operating systems - </span>Many operating systems, including UNIX and Linux, are written in C.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li><span class="bold">Embedded System - </span>C is used in microcontrollers and firmware development for hardware devices.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li><span class="bold">Game Development - </span>Game engines often utilize C for performance-critical tasks.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li><span class="bold">Compilers and Interpreters - </span>Many modern programming languages have compilers written in C.</li>
            <p></p>
        </ol>
        <h2>Why Learn C?</h2>
        <p>Learning C provides a strong foundation in programming logic and computer architecture. It enhances problem-solving skills and prepares developers for learning other languages like C++, Java, and Python.</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>C remains one of the most influential programming languages, offering speed, flexibility, and control over system resources. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced programmer, understanding C can significantly boost your technical expertise and open doors to various career opportunities.</p>
